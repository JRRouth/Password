# Password
This is a simple password generator script written in Python. It generates random, secure passwords by selecting from a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers, ensuring varied and strong combinations. Each password is 12 characters long by default. The generated passwords are saved to a passwords.txt file, with an option to generate additional passwords continuously. This script is ideal for educational purposes, demonstrating basic Python programming concepts such as loops, file handling, and random selection.

Note: This is an educational project and is not intended to replace secure password management solutions for sensitive or production environments.
